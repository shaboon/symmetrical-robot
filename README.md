# Interstellar Index - The Complete Guide For Canon Catch Up

## Description

This application is designed to enable users to explore Star Wars characters featured in the vast Star Wars movie-verse. It allows users to discover which movies and series showcase a particular character. Once users find information about a specific character, they can save the corresponding works into a watchlist. This feature provides users with a comprehensive list that facilitates their immersion in the character's story and lore.

Given the abundance of content emerging from the Star Wars universe in recent times, our goal was to develop a sleek and user-friendly app. Our app enables users to keep up with the current developments in the Star Wars universe at their own pace. By leveraging our application, users can easily locate their favorite familiar characters or explore new characters for which they seek additional information. By curating a personalized watchlist, users can access all the necessary background information and truly embrace the status of a Star Wars expert!

## Usage
When the app is launched, users will be greeted by an engaging home page offering multiple options to explore. They can dive right in and start browsing Star Wars characters, or if they've had their fill of Star Wars content, they can unwind and enjoy our built-in game! However, before getting started, users need to log in to access all features, including the ability to create a personalized watchlist.

Once logged in, users can explore the extensive library of Star Wars characters and begin crafting their own unique watchlist. Each character entry will include a list of appearances that users can add to their watchlist and assign a customized title to. For instance, users could create a watchlist named "Anakin" and compile all the movies and series where Anakin is mentioned or featured, thus becoming truly knowledgeable about our beloved Jedi ðŸ˜ˆ.

After creating their tailored watchlist, users will have access to additional information about each piece of media they have saved. They can delve into reviews, discover in-depth details, and view a poster for each title, enhancing their overall experience and understanding.
